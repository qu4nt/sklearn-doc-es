"This example shows that model selection can be performed with Gaussian "
"Mixture Models using information-theoretic criteria (BIC). Model "
"selection concerns both the covariance type and the number of components "
"in the model. In that case, AIC also provides the right result (not shown"
" to save time), but BIC is better suited if the problem is to identify "
"the right model. Unlike Bayesian procedures, such inferences are prior-"
"free."
