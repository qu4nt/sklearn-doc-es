"This examples demonstrates how to precompute the k nearest neighbors "
"before using them in KNeighborsClassifier. KNeighborsClassifier can "
"compute the nearest neighbors internally, but precomputing them can have "
"several benefits, such as finer parameter control, caching for multiple "
"use, or custom implementations."

"Here we use the caching property of pipelines to cache the nearest "
"neighbors graph between multiple fits of KNeighborsClassifier. The first "
"call is slow since it computes the neighbors graph, while subsequent call"
" are faster as they do not need to recompute the graph. Here the "
"durations are small since the dataset is small, but the gain can be more "
"substantial when the dataset grows larger, or when the grid of parameter "
"to search is large."
