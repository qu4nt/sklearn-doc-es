"Transform a signal as a sparse combination of Ricker wavelets. This "
"example visually compares different sparse coding methods using the "
":class:`~sklearn.decomposition.SparseCoder` estimator. The Ricker (also "
"known as Mexican hat or the second derivative of a Gaussian) is not a "
"particularly good kernel to represent piecewise constant signals like "
"this one. It can therefore be seen how much adding different widths of "
"atoms matters and it therefore motivates learning the dictionary to best "
"fit your type of signals."
