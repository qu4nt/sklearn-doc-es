"An example comparing the effect of reconstructing noisy fragments of a "
"raccoon face image using firstly online :ref:`DictionaryLearning` and "
"various transform methods."

"The dictionary is fitted on the distorted left half of the image, and "
"subsequently used to reconstruct the right half. Note that even better "
"performance could be achieved by fitting to an undistorted (i.e. "
"noiseless) image, but here we start from the assumption that it is not "
"available."

"A common practice for evaluating the results of image denoising is by "
"looking at the difference between the reconstruction and the original "
"image. If the reconstruction is perfect this will look like Gaussian "
"noise."

"It can be seen from the plots that the results of :ref:`omp` with two "
"non-zero coefficients is a bit less biased than when keeping only one "
"(the edges look less prominent). It is in addition closer from the ground"
" truth in Frobenius norm."

"The result of :ref:`least_angle_regression` is much more strongly biased:"
" the difference is reminiscent of the local intensity value of the "
"original image."

"Thresholding is clearly not useful for denoising, but it is here to show "
"that it can produce a suggestive output with very high speed, and thus be"
" useful for other tasks such as object classification, where performance "
"is not necessarily related to visualisation."
