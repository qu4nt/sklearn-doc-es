"Due to the few points in each dimension and the straight line that linear"
" regression uses to follow these points as well as it can, noise on the "
"observations will cause great variance as shown in the first plot. Every "
"line's slope can vary quite a bit for each prediction due to the noise "
"induced in the observations."

"Ridge regression is basically minimizing a penalised version of the "
"least-squared function. The penalising `shrinks` the value of the "
"regression coefficients. Despite the few data points in each dimension, "
"the slope of the prediction is much more stable and the variance in the "
"line itself is greatly reduced, in comparison to that of the standard "
"linear regression"
