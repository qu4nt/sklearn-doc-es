"Comparison of the sparsity (percentage of zero coefficients) of solutions"
" when L1, L2 and Elastic-Net penalty are used for different values of C. "
"We can see that large values of C give more freedom to the model.  "
"Conversely, smaller values of C constrain the model more. In the L1 "
"penalty case, this leads to sparser solutions. As expected, the Elastic-"
"Net penalty sparsity is between that of L1 and L2."
