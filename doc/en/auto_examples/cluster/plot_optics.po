"Finds core samples of high density and expands clusters from them. This "
"example uses data that is generated so that the clusters have different "
"densities. The :class:`~cluster.OPTICS` is first used with its Xi cluster"
" detection method, and then setting specific thresholds on the "
"reachability, which corresponds to :class:`~cluster.DBSCAN`. We can see "
"that the different clusters of OPTICS's Xi method can be recovered with "
"different choices of thresholds in DBSCAN."
