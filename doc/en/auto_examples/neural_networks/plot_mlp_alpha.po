"A comparison of different values for regularization parameter 'alpha' on "
"synthetic datasets. The plot shows that different alphas yield different "
"decision functions."

msgid ""
"Alpha is a parameter for regularization term, aka penalty term, that "
"combats overfitting by constraining the size of the weights. Increasing "
"alpha may fix high variance (a sign of overfitting) by encouraging "
"smaller weights, resulting in a decision boundary plot that appears with "
"lesser curvatures. Similarly, decreasing alpha may fix high bias (a sign "
"of underfitting) by encouraging larger weights, potentially resulting in "
"a more complicated decision boundary."
