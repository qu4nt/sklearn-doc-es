"When performing classification you often want to predict not only the "
"class label, but also the associated probability. This probability gives "
"you some kind of confidence on the prediction. However, not all "
"classifiers provide well-calibrated probabilities, some being over-"
"confident while others being under-confident. Thus, a separate "
"calibration of predicted probabilities is often desirable as a "
"postprocessing. This example illustrates two different methods for this "
"calibration and evaluates the quality of the returned probabilities using"
" Brier's score (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score)."

"Compared are the estimated probability using a Gaussian naive Bayes "
"classifier without calibration, with a sigmoid calibration, and with a "
"non-parametric isotonic calibration. One can observe that only the non-"
"parametric model is able to provide a probability calibration that "
"returns probabilities close to the expected 0.5 for most of the samples "
"belonging to the middle cluster with heterogeneous labels. This results "
"in a significantly improved Brier score."
