"As F-test captures only linear dependency, it rates x_1 as the most "
"discriminative feature. On the other hand, mutual information can capture"
" any kind of dependency between variables and it rates x_2 as the most "
"discriminative feature, which probably agrees better with our intuitive "
"perception for this example. Both methods correctly marks x_3 as "
"irrelevant."
