"This example constructs a pipeline that does dimensionality reduction "
"followed by prediction with a support vector classifier. It demonstrates "
"the use of ``GridSearchCV`` and ``Pipeline`` to optimize over different "
"classes of estimators in a single CV run -- unsupervised ``PCA`` and "
"``NMF`` dimensionality reductions are compared to univariate feature "
"selection during the grid search."

"It is sometimes worthwhile storing the state of a specific transformer "
"since it could be used again. Using a pipeline in ``GridSearchCV`` "
"triggers such situations. Therefore, we use the argument ``memory`` to "
"enable caching."

"Note that this example is, however, only an illustration since for this "
"specific case fitting PCA is not necessarily slower than loading the "
"cache. Hence, use the ``memory`` constructor parameter when the fitting "
"of a transformer is costly."

msgid ""
"The ``PCA`` fitting is only computed at the evaluation of the first "
"configuration of the ``C`` parameter of the ``LinearSVC`` classifier. The"
" other configurations of ``C`` will trigger the loading of the cached "
"``PCA`` estimator data, leading to save processing time. Therefore, the "
"use of caching the pipeline using ``memory`` is highly beneficial when "
"fitting a transformer is costly."
