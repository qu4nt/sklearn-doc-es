"This example illustrates that GPR with a sum-kernel including a "
"WhiteKernel can estimate the noise level of data. An illustration of the "
"log-marginal-likelihood (LML) landscape shows that there exist two local "
"maxima of LML. The first corresponds to a model with a high noise level "
"and a large length scale, which explains all variations in the data by "
"noise. The second one has a smaller noise level and shorter length scale,"
" which explains most of the variation by the noise-free functional "
"relationship. The second model has a higher likelihood; however, "
"depending on the initial value for the hyperparameters, the gradient-"
"based optimization might also converge to the high-noise solution. It is "
"thus important to repeat the optimization several times for different "
"initializations."
