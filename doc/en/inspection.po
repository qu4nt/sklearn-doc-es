"Predictive performance is often the main goal of developing machine "
"learning models. Yet summarising performance with an evaluation metric is"
" often insufficient: it assumes that the evaluation metric and test "
"dataset perfectly reflect the target domain, which is rarely true. In "
"certain domains, a model needs a certain level of interpretability before"
" it can be deployed. A model that is exhibiting performance issues needs "
"to be debugged for one to understand the model's underlying issue. The "
":mod:`sklearn.inspection` module provides tools to help understand the "
"predictions from a model and what affects them. This can be used to "
"evaluate assumptions and biases of a model, design a better model, or to "
"diagnose issues with model performance."
