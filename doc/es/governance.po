msgstr "La gestión y toma de decisiones en el ámbito de la ciencia"

#: ../governance.rst:7
msgid "The purpose of this document is to formalize the governance process used by the scikit-learn project, to clarify how decisions are made and how the various elements of our community interact. This document establishes a decision-making structure that takes into account feedback from all members of the community and strives to find consensus, while avoiding any deadlocks."

#: ../governance.rst:14
msgid "This is a meritocratic, consensus-based community project. Anyone with an interest in the project can join the community, contribute to the project design and participate in the decision making process. This document describes how that participation takes place and how to set about earning merit within the project community."

msgid "Similarly to what has been decided in the `python project <https://devguide.python.org/triaging/#becoming-a-member-of-the-python-triage-team>`_, any contributor may become a member of the scikit-learn triage team, after showing some continuity in participating to scikit-learn development (with pull requests and reviews). Any core developer is welcome to propose a scikit-learn contributor to join the triage team. Other core developers are then consulted: while it is expected that most acceptances will be unanimous, a two-thirds majority is enough. Every new triager will be announced in the mailing list. Triagers are welcome to participate in `monthly core developer meetings <https://github.com/scikit-learn/administrative/tree/master/meeting_notes>`_."

#: ../governance.rst:52
msgid "Core developers are community members who have shown that they are dedicated to the continued development of the project through ongoing engagement with the community. They have shown they can be trusted to maintain scikit-learn with care. Being a core developer allows contributors to more easily carry on with their project related activities by giving them direct access to the project’s repository and is represented as being an organization member on the scikit-learn `GitHub organization <https://github.com/orgs/scikit-learn/people>`_. Core developers are expected to review code contributions, can merge approved pull requests, can cast votes for and against merging a pull-request, and can be involved in deciding major changes to the API."
msgstr ""

#: ../governance.rst:64
msgid "New core developers can be nominated by any existing core developers. Once they have been nominated, there will be a vote by the current core developers. Voting on new core developers is one of the few activities that takes place on the project's private management list. While it is expected that most votes will be unanimous, a two-thirds majority of the cast votes is enough. The vote needs to be open for at least 1 week."

msgid "Core developers that have not contributed to the project (commits or GitHub comments) in the past 12 months will be asked if they want to become emeritus core developers and recant their commit and voting rights until they become active again. The list of core developers, active and emeritus (with dates at which they became active) is public on the scikit-learn website."

msgid "The Technical Committee (TC) members are core developers who have additional responsibilities to ensure the smooth running of the project. TC members are expected to participate in strategic planning, and approve changes to the governance model. The purpose of the TC is to ensure a smooth progress from the big-picture perspective. Indeed changes that impact the full project require a synthetic analysis and a consensus that is both explicit and informed. In cases that the core developer community (which includes the TC members) fails to reach such a consensus in the required time frame, the TC is the entity to resolve the issue. Membership of the TC is by nomination by a core developer. A nomination will result in discussion which cannot take more than a month and then a vote by the core developers which will stay open for a week. TC membership votes are subject to a two-third majority of all cast votes as well as a simple majority approval of all the current TC members. TC members who do not actively engage with the TC duties are expected to resign."

All non-sensitive project management discussion takes place on the project contributors’ `mailing list <mailto:scikit-learn@python.org>`_ and the `issue tracker <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues>`_. Occasionally, sensitive discussion occurs on a private list."
msgstr ""

#: ../governance.rst:109
msgid "Scikit-learn uses a \"consensus seeking\" process for making decisions. The group tries to find a resolution that has no open objections among core developers. At any point during the discussion, any core-developer can call for a vote, which will conclude one month from the call for the vote. Any vote must be backed by a :ref:`SLEP <slep>`. If no option can gather two thirds of the votes cast, the decision is escalated to the TC, which in turn will use consensus seeking with the fallback option of a simple majority vote if no consensus can be found within a month. This is what we hereafter may refer to as “the decision making process”."
