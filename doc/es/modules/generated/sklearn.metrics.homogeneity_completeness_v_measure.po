msgid "Those 3 metrics are independent of the absolute values of the labels: a permutation of the class or cluster label values won't change the score values in any way."

msgid "V-Measure is furthermore symmetric: swapping ``labels_true`` and ``label_pred`` will give the same score. This does not hold for homogeneity and completeness. V-Measure is identical to :func:`normalized_mutual_info_score` with the arithmetic averaging method."
