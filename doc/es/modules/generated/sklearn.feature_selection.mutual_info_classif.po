msgid "Mutual information (MI) [R50b872b699c4-1]_ between two random variables is a non-negative value, which measures the dependency between the variables. It is equal to zero if and only if two random variables are independent, and higher values mean higher dependency."

msgid "The function relies on nonparametric methods based on entropy estimation from k-nearest neighbors distances as described in [R50b872b699c4-2]_ and [R50b872b699c4-3]_. Both methods are based on the idea originally proposed in [R50b872b699c4-4]_."

msgid "The term \"discrete features\" is used instead of naming them \"categorical\", because it describes the essence more accurately. For example, pixel intensities of an image are discrete features (but hardly categorical) and you will get better results if mark them as such. Also note, that treating a continuous variable as discrete and vice versa will usually give incorrect results, so be attentive about that."
