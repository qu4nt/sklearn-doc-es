msgid "For an estimator to be effective, you need the distance between neighboring points to be less than some value :math:`d`, which depends on the problem. In one dimension, this requires on average :math:`n \\sim 1/d` points. In the context of the above :math:`k`-NN example, if the data is described by just one feature with values ranging from 0 to 1 and with :math:`n` training observations, then new data will be no further away than :math:`1/n`. Therefore, the nearest neighbor decision rule will be efficient as soon as :math:`1/n` is small compared to the scale of between-class feature variations."

Let's say that we require 10 points in one dimension: now :math:`10^p` points are required in :math:`p` dimensions to pave the :math:`[0, 1]` space.
