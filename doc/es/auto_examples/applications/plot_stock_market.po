msgid "The quantity that we use is the daily variation in quote price: quotes that are linked tend to cofluctuate during a day."

#: ../auto_examples/applications/plot_stock_market.rst:36
msgid "We use sparse inverse covariance estimation to find which quotes are correlated conditionally on the others. Specifically, sparse inverse covariance gives us a graph, that is a list of connection. For each symbol, the symbols that it is connected too are those useful to explain its fluctuations."

msgid "Clustering"
msgstr ""

#: ../auto_examples/applications/plot_stock_market.rst:45
msgid "We use clustering to group together quotes that behave similarly. Here, amongst the :ref:`various clustering techniques <clustering>` available in the scikit-learn, we use :ref:`affinity_propagation` as it does not enforce equal-size clusters, and it can choose automatically the number of clusters from the data."
msgstr ""

#: ../auto_examples/applications/plot_stock_market.rst:51
msgid "Note that this gives us a different indication than the graph, as the graph reflects conditional relations between variables, while the clustering reflects marginal properties: variables clustered together can be considered as having a similar impact at the level of the full stock market."
