msgstr ""

#: ../auto_examples/mixture/plot_gmm.rst:30
msgid "Both models have access to five components with which to fit the data. Note that the Expectation Maximisation model will necessarily use all five components while the Variational Inference model will effectively only use as many as are needed for a good fit. Here we can see that the Expectation Maximisation model splits some components arbitrarily, because it is trying to fit too many components, while the Dirichlet Process model adapts it number of state automatically."

#: ../auto_examples/mixture/plot_gmm.rst:38
msgid "This example doesn't show it, as we're in a low-dimensional space, but another advantage of the Dirichlet process model is that it can fit full covariance matrices effectively even when there are less examples per cluster than there are dimensions in the data, due to regularization properties of the inference algorithm."
