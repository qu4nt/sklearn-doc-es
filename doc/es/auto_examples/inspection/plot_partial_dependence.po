msgstr ""

#: ../auto_examples/inspection/plot_partial_dependence.rst:25
msgid "Partial dependence plots show the dependence between the target function [2]_ and a set of features of interest, marginalizing over the values of all other features (the complement features). Due to the limits of human perception, the size of the set of features of interest must be small (usually, one or two) thus they are usually chosen among the most important features."
msgstr ""

#: ../auto_examples/inspection/plot_partial_dependence.rst:31
msgid "Similarly, an individual conditional expectation (ICE) plot [3]_ shows the dependence between the target function and a feature of interest. However, unlike partial dependence plots, which show the average effect of the features of interest, ICE plots visualize the dependence of the prediction on a feature for each :term:`sample` separately, with one line per sample. Only one feature of interest is supported for ICE plots."

msgid "We can clearly see on the PDPs (thick blue line) that the median house price shows a linear relationship with the median income (top left) and that the house price drops when the average occupants per household increases (top middle). The top right plot shows that the house age in a district does not have a strong influence on the (median) house price; so does the average rooms per household."
msgstr ""

#: ../auto_examples/inspection/plot_partial_dependence.rst:326
msgid "The ICE curves (light blue lines) complement the analysis: we can see that there are some exceptions, where the house price remain constant with median income and average occupants. On the other hand, while the house age (top right) does not have a strong influence on the median house price on average, there seems to be a number of exceptions where the house price increase when between the ages 15-25. Similar exceptions can be observed for the average number of rooms (bottom left). Therefore, ICE plots show some individual effect which are attenuated by taking the averages."

Another consideration is linked to the performance to compute the PDPs. With the tree-based algorithm, when only PDPs are requested, they can be computed on an efficient way using the `'recursion'` method."
