msgid "In linear models, the target value is modeled as a linear combination of the features (see the :ref:`linear_model` User Guide section for a description of a set of linear models available in scikit-learn). Coefficients in multiple linear models represent the relationship between the given feature, :math:`X_i` and the target, :math:`y`, assuming that all the other features remain constant (`conditional dependence <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_dependence>`_). This is different from plotting :math:`X_i` versus :math:`y` and fitting a linear relationship: in that case all possible values of the other features are taken into account in the estimation (marginal dependence)."

msgid "The AGE coefficient is expressed in \"dollars/hour per living years\" while the EDUCATION one is expressed in \"dollars/hour per years of education\". This representation of the coefficients has the benefit of making clear the practical predictions of the model: an increase of :math:`1` year in AGE means a decrease of :math:`0.030867` dollars/hour, while an increase of :math:`1` year in EDUCATION means an increase of :math:`0.054699` dollars/hour. On the other hand, categorical variables (as UNION or SEX) are adimensional numbers taking either the value 0 or 1. Their coefficients are expressed in dollars/hour. Then, we cannot compare the magnitude of different coefficients since the features have different natural scales, and hence value ranges, because of their different unit of measure. This is more visible if we plot the coefficients."
