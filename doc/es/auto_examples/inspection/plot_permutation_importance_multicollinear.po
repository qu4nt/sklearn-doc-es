msgid "In this example, we compute the permutation importance on the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset using :func:`~sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance`. The :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` can easily get about 97% accuracy on a test dataset. Because this dataset contains multicollinear features, the permutation importance will show that none of the features are important. One approach to handling multicollinearity is by performing hierarchical clustering on the features' Spearman rank-order correlations, picking a threshold, and keeping a single feature from each cluster."

msgid "Next, we plot the tree based feature importance and the permutation importance. The permutation importance plot shows that permuting a feature drops the accuracy by at most `0.012`, which would suggest that none of the features are important. This is in contradiction with the high test accuracy computed above: some feature must be important. The permutation importance is calculated on the training set to show how much the model relies on each feature during training."

msgstr ""

#: ../auto_examples/inspection/plot_permutation_importance_multicollinear.rst:152
msgid "When features are collinear, permutating one feature will have little effect on the models performance because it can get the same information from a correlated feature. One way to handle multicollinear features is by performing hierarchical clustering on the Spearman rank-order correlations, picking a threshold, and keeping a single feature from each cluster. First, we plot a heatmap of the correlated features:"

msgid "Next, we manually pick a threshold by visual inspection of the dendrogram to group our features into clusters and choose a feature from each cluster to keep, select those features from our dataset, and train a new random forest. The test accuracy of the new random forest did not change much compared to the random forest trained on the complete dataset."
