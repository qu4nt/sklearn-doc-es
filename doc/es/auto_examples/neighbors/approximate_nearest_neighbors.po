msgid "This example presents how to chain KNeighborsTransformer and TSNE in a pipeline. It also shows how to wrap the packages `annoy` and `nmslib` to replace KNeighborsTransformer and perform approximate nearest neighbors. These packages can be installed with `pip install annoy nmslib`."

msgid "Note: Currently `TSNE(metric='precomputed')` does not modify the precomputed distances, and thus assumes that precomputed euclidean distances are squared. In future versions, a parameter in TSNE will control the optional squaring of precomputed distances (see #12401)."

msgid "Note: In KNeighborsTransformer we use the definition which includes each training point as its own neighbor in the count of `n_neighbors`, and for compatibility reasons, one extra neighbor is computed when `mode == 'distance'`. Please note that we do the same in the proposed wrappers."
