msgid "This example shows characteristics of different anomaly detection algorithms on 2D datasets. Datasets contain one or two modes (regions of high density) to illustrate the ability of algorithms to cope with multimodal data."

msgid "For each dataset, 15% of samples are generated as random uniform noise. This proportion is the value given to the nu parameter of the OneClassSVM and the contamination parameter of the other outlier detection algorithms. Decision boundaries between inliers and outliers are displayed in black except for Local Outlier Factor (LOF) as it has no predict method to be applied on new data when it is used for outlier detection."

msgid "The :class:`~sklearn.svm.OneClassSVM` is known to be sensitive to outliers and thus does not perform very well for outlier detection. This estimator is best suited for novelty detection when the training set is not contaminated by outliers. That said, outlier detection in high-dimension, or without any assumptions on the distribution of the inlying data is very challenging, and a One-class SVM might give useful results in these situations depending on the value of its hyperparameters."

msgid ":class:`~sklearn.covariance.EllipticEnvelope` assumes the data is Gaussian and learns an ellipse. It thus degrades when the data is not unimodal. Notice however that this estimator is robust to outliers."
msgstr ""

#: ../auto_examples/miscellaneous/plot_anomaly_comparison.rst:48
msgid ":class:`~sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest` and :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor` seem to perform reasonably well for multi-modal data sets. The advantage of :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor` over the other estimators is shown for the third data set, where the two modes have different densities. This advantage is explained by the local aspect of LOF, meaning that it only compares the score of abnormality of one sample with the scores of its neighbors."

msgid "Finally, for the last data set, it is hard to say that one sample is more abnormal than another sample as they are uniformly distributed in a hypercube. Except for the :class:`~sklearn.svm.OneClassSVM` which overfits a little, all estimators present decent solutions for this situation. In such a case, it would be wise to look more closely at the scores of abnormality of the samples as a good estimator should assign similar scores to all the samples."

msgid "Finally, note that parameters of the models have been here handpicked but that in practice they need to be adjusted. In the absence of labelled data, the problem is completely unsupervised so model selection can be a challenge."
