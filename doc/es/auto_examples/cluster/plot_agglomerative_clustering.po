msgid "Second, when using a connectivity matrix, single, average and complete linkage are unstable and tend to create a few clusters that grow very quickly. Indeed, average and complete linkage fight this percolation behavior by considering all the distances between two clusters when merging them ( while single linkage exaggerates the behaviour by considering only the shortest distance between clusters). The connectivity graph breaks this mechanism for average and complete linkage, making them resemble the more brittle single linkage. This effect is more pronounced for very sparse graphs (try decreasing the number of neighbors in kneighbors_graph) and with complete linkage. In particular, having a very small number of neighbors in the graph, imposes a geometry that is close to that of single linkage, which is well known to have this percolation instability."
