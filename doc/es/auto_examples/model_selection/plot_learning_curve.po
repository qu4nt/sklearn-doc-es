msgid "In the first column, first row the learning curve of a naive Bayes classifier is shown for the digits dataset. Note that the training score and the cross-validation score are both not very good at the end. However, the shape of the curve can be found in more complex datasets very often: the training score is very high at the beginning and decreases and the cross-validation score is very low at the beginning and increases. In the second column, first row we see the learning curve of an SVM with RBF kernel. We can see clearly that the training score is still around the maximum and the validation score could be increased with more training samples. The plots in the second row show the times required by the models to train with various sizes of training dataset. The plots in the third row show how much time was required to train the models for each training sizes."
