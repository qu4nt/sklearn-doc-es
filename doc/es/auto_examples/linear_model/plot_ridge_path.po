#: ../auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ridge_path.rst:34
msgid "This example also shows the usefulness of applying Ridge regression to highly ill-conditioned matrices. For such matrices, a slight change in the target variable can cause huge variances in the calculated weights. In such cases, it is useful to set a certain regularization (alpha) to reduce this variation (noise)."
msgstr ""

#: ../auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ridge_path.rst:40
msgid "When alpha is very large, the regularization effect dominates the squared loss function and the coefficients tend to zero. At the end of the path, as alpha tends toward zero and the solution tends towards the ordinary least squares, coefficients exhibit big oscillations. In practise it is necessary to tune alpha in such a way that a balance is maintained between both."
