msgid "The models are ordered from strongest regularized to least regularized. The 4 coefficients of the models are collected and plotted as a \"regularization path\": on the left-hand side of the figure (strong regularizers), all the coefficients are exactly 0. When regularization gets progressively looser, coefficients can get non-zero values one after the other."

msgid "Here we choose the liblinear solver because it can efficiently optimize for the Logistic Regression loss with a non-smooth, sparsity inducing l1 penalty."

msgid "Also note that we set a low value for the tolerance to make sure that the model has converged before collecting the coefficients."

msgid "We also use warm_start=True which means that the coefficients of the models are reused to initialize the next model fit to speed-up the computation of the full-path."
