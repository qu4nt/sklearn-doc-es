msgstr ""

#: ../roadmap.rst:34
msgid "A more subtle change over the last decade is that, due to changing interests in ML, PhD students in machine learning are more likely to contribute to PyTorch, Dask, etc. than to Scikit-learn, so our contributor pool is very different to a decade ago."
msgstr ""

#: ../roadmap.rst:39
msgid "Scikit-learn remains very popular in practice for trying out canonical machine learning techniques, particularly for applications in experimental science and in data science. A lot of what we provide is now very mature. But it can be costly to maintain, and we cannot therefore include arbitrary new implementations. Yet Scikit-learn is also essential in defining an API framework for the development of interoperable machine learning components external to the core library."
