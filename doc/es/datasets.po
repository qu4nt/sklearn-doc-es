msgid "The ``sklearn.datasets`` package embeds some small toy datasets as introduced in the :ref:`Getting Started <loading_example_dataset>` section."
msgstr ""

#: ../datasets.rst:18
msgid "This package also features helpers to fetch larger datasets commonly used by the machine learning community to benchmark algorithms on data that comes from the 'real world'."
msgstr ""

#: ../datasets.rst:22
msgid "To evaluate the impact of the scale of the dataset (``n_samples`` and ``n_features``) while controlling the statistical properties of the data (typically the correlation and informativeness of the features), it is also possible to generate synthetic data."
msgstr ""

#: ../datasets.rst:27
msgid "**General dataset API.** There are three main kinds of dataset interfaces that can be used to get datasets depending on the desired type of dataset."
msgstr ""

#: ../datasets.rst:30
msgid "**The dataset loaders.** They can be used to load small standard datasets, described in the :ref:`toy_datasets` section."
msgstr ""

#: ../datasets.rst:33
msgid "**The dataset fetchers.** They can be used to download and load larger datasets, described in the :ref:`real_world_datasets` section."
msgstr ""

#: ../datasets.rst:36
msgid "Both loaders and fetchers functions return a :class:`~sklearn.utils.Bunch` object holding at least two items: an array of shape ``n_samples`` * ``n_features`` with key ``data`` (except for 20newsgroups) and a numpy array of length ``n_samples``, containing the target values, with key ``target``."
msgstr ""

#: ../datasets.rst:42
msgid "The Bunch object is a dictionary that exposes its keys as attributes. For more information about Bunch object, see :class:`~sklearn.utils.Bunch`."
msgstr ""

#: ../datasets.rst:45
msgid "It's also possible for almost all of these function to constrain the output to be a tuple containing only the data and the target, by setting the ``return_X_y`` parameter to ``True``."
msgstr ""

#: ../datasets.rst:49
msgid "The datasets also contain a full description in their ``DESCR`` attribute and some contain ``feature_names`` and ``target_names``. See the dataset descriptions below for details."
msgstr ""

#: ../datasets.rst:53
msgid "**The dataset generation functions.** They can be used to generate controlled synthetic datasets, described in the :ref:`sample_generators` section."
msgstr ""

#: ../datasets.rst:56
msgid "These functions return a tuple ``(X, y)`` consisting of a ``n_samples`` * ``n_features`` numpy array ``X`` and an array of length ``n_samples`` containing the targets ``y``."
msgstr ""

#: ../datasets.rst:60
msgid "In addition, there are also miscellaneous tools to load datasets of other formats or from other locations, described in the :ref:`loading_other_datasets` section."
