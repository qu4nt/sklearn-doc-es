"The :term:`estimator` is required to be a fitted estimator. `X` can be "
"the data set used to train the estimator or a hold-out set. The "
"permutation importance of a feature is calculated as follows. First, a "
"baseline metric, defined by :term:`scoring`, is evaluated on a "
"(potentially different) dataset defined by the `X`. Next, a feature "
"column from the validation set is permuted and the metric is evaluated "
"again. The permutation importance is defined to be the difference between"
" the baseline metric and metric from permutating the feature column."
