"This example illustrates the effect of a varying threshold on self-"
"training. The `breast_cancer` dataset is loaded, and labels are deleted "
"such that only 50 out of 569 samples have labels. A "
"`SelfTrainingClassifier` is fitted on this dataset, with varying "
"thresholds."

"The upper graph shows the amount of labeled samples that the classifier "
"has available by the end of fit, and the accuracy of the classifier. The "
"lower graph shows the last iteration in which a sample was labeled. All "
"values are cross validated with 3 folds."

"At low thresholds (in [0.4, 0.5]), the classifier learns from samples "
"that were labeled with a low confidence. These low-confidence samples are"
" likely have incorrect predicted labels, and as a result, fitting on "
"these incorrect labels produces a poor accuracy. Note that the classifier"
" labels almost all of the samples, and only takes one iteration."

"For very high thresholds (in [0.9, 1)) we observe that the classifier "
"does not augment its dataset (the amount of self-labeled samples is 0). "
"As a result, the accuracy achieved with a threshold of 0.9999 is the same"
" as a normal supervised classifier would achieve."
