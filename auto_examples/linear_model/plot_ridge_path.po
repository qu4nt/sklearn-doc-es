":class:`Ridge` Regression is the estimator used in this example. Each "
"color represents a different feature of the coefficient vector, and this "
"is displayed as a function of the regularization parameter."

"This example also shows the usefulness of applying Ridge regression to "
"highly ill-conditioned matrices. For such matrices, a slight change in "
"the target variable can cause huge variances in the calculated weights. "
"In such cases, it is useful to set a certain regularization (alpha) to "
"reduce this variation (noise)."

#: ../auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ridge_path.rst:40
msgid ""
"When alpha is very large, the regularization effect dominates the squared"
" loss function and the coefficients tend to zero. At the end of the path,"
" as alpha tends toward zero and the solution tends towards the ordinary "
"least squares, coefficients exhibit big oscillations. In practise it is "
"necessary to tune alpha in such a way that a balance is maintained "
"between both."
