"Here we fit a multinomial logistic regression with L1 penalty on a subset"
" of the MNIST digits classification task. We use the SAGA algorithm for "
"this purpose: this a solver that is fast when the number of samples is "
"significantly larger than the number of features and is able to finely "
"optimize non-smooth objective functions which is the case with the "
"l1-penalty. Test accuracy reaches > 0.8, while weight vectors remains "
"*sparse* and therefore more easily *interpretable*."
