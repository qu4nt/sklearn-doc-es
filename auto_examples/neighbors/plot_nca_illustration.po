"This example illustrates a learned distance metric that maximizes the "
"nearest neighbors classification accuracy. It provides a visual "
"representation of this metric compared to the original point space. "

"First we create a data set of 9 samples from 3 classes, and plot the "
"points in the original space. For this example, we focus on the "
"classification of point no. 3. The thickness of a link between point no. "
"3 and another point is proportional to their distance."
