msgid ""
"The Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm is an unsupervised anomaly "
"detection method which computes the local density deviation of a given "
"data point with respect to its neighbors. It considers as outliers the "
"samples that have a substantially lower density than their neighbors. "
"This example shows how to use LOF for outlier detection which is the "
"default use case of this estimator in scikit-learn. Note that when LOF is"
" used for outlier detection it has no predict, decision_function and "
"score_samples methods. See :ref:`User Guide <outlier_detection>`: for "
"details on the difference between outlier detection and novelty detection"
" and how to use LOF for novelty detection."

msgid ""
"The number of neighbors considered (parameter n_neighbors) is typically "
"set 1) greater than the minimum number of samples a cluster has to "
"contain, so that other samples can be local outliers relative to this "
"cluster, and 2) smaller than the maximum number of close by samples that "
"can potentially be local outliers. In practice, such informations are "
"generally not available, and taking n_neighbors=20 appears to work well "
"in general."
