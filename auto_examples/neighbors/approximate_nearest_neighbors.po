"This example presents how to chain KNeighborsTransformer and TSNE in a "
"pipeline. It also shows how to wrap the packages `annoy` and `nmslib` to "
"replace KNeighborsTransformer and perform approximate nearest neighbors. "
"These packages can be installed with `pip install annoy nmslib`."

"Note: Currently `TSNE(metric='precomputed')` does not modify the "
"precomputed distances, and thus assumes that precomputed euclidean "
"distances are squared. In future versions, a parameter in TSNE will "
"control the optional squaring of precomputed distances (see #12401)."

"Note: In KNeighborsTransformer we use the definition which includes each "
"training point as its own neighbor in the count of `n_neighbors`, and for"
" compatibility reasons, one extra neighbor is computed when `mode == "
"'distance'`. Please note that we do the same in the proposed wrappers."
