"Plot the confidence ellipsoids of a mixture of two Gaussians obtained "
"with Expectation Maximisation (``GaussianMixture`` class) and Variational"
" Inference (``BayesianGaussianMixture`` class models with a Dirichlet "
"process prior)."

"Both models have access to five components with which to fit the data. "
"Note that the Expectation Maximisation model will necessarily use all "
"five components while the Variational Inference model will effectively "
"only use as many as are needed for a good fit. Here we can see that the "
"Expectation Maximisation model splits some components arbitrarily, "
"because it is trying to fit too many components, while the Dirichlet "
"Process model adapts it number of state automatically."

"This example doesn't show it, as we're in a low-dimensional space, but "
"another advantage of the Dirichlet process model is that it can fit full "
"covariance matrices effectively even when there are less examples per "
"cluster than there are dimensions in the data, due to regularization "
"properties of the inference algorithm."
