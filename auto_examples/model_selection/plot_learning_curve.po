"In the first column, first row the learning curve of a naive Bayes "
"classifier is shown for the digits dataset. Note that the training score "
"and the cross-validation score are both not very good at the end. "
"However, the shape of the curve can be found in more complex datasets "
"very often: the training score is very high at the beginning and "
"decreases and the cross-validation score is very low at the beginning and"
" increases. In the second column, first row we see the learning curve of "
"an SVM with RBF kernel. We can see clearly that the training score is "
"still around the maximum and the validation score could be increased with"
" more training samples. The plots in the second row show the times "
"required by the models to train with various sizes of training dataset. "
"The plots in the third row show how much time was required to train the "
"models for each training sizes."
